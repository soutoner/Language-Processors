Language Processors
===================

Personal work on the subject of language Processors. Contains original exercises, test cases and reference binaries (none made of these by me).

### Content:

#### Skeleton of the repository

* {version}**C**: each version has its own features.
	* {version}**-bin**: binary reference files for this compiler.
	* {version}**-test**: some example code for testing purposes.
	* {version}**.pdf**: original exercise. 
	* {version}**C.cup**: CUP file for the compiler (analyzer).
	* {version}**C.flex**: JFlex file for the compiler (tokenizer).
	* {version}**C.java**: main Java class.
	* **compile.sh**: shell script with the three compile steps (improve workflow).
	* **runtest.sh**: shell script that runs all the test case and compare the provided solution with the reference one.
	* **auxiliary files**: commented in the next section.
* **ctd-bin**: binary files of the three-address code interpreter (intermediate code that is generated by the compiler). 

#### Other files inside each folder:

 * **PLC**:  PL compiler.
	 * **Condition**.java: auxiliary Java class for conditions.
	 * **Print.java**: auxiliary Java class for printing purposes.
	 
 * **PLXC**: PL+ compiler (support more features).
	 * **Condition**.java: auxiliary Java class for conditions.
	 * **Print.java**: auxiliary Java class for printing purposes.
	 * **SymbolTable.java**: auxiliary Java class that mantains the Symbol Table (variables scopes).
